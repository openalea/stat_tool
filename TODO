- Fix “ContinousParametric” and “ContinousParametricProcess” classes API documentation
- Move "Usage Example" from "User guide" section to "Usage" section
- Add docstrings to constants. Simply add "///" instead of "//" ?
- Welcome page: better integrate code lines (`pip install...`). Also move section "Note for developpers" into a more appropriated section ?
